# onlineFDR Explore

## Introduction
Welcome to the onlineFDR Explore Shiny app. This repository contains an application that is an interface to the onlineFDR package hosted on Bioconductor. It is designed to assist researchers in controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in an online manner. The app provides a family of algorithms that users can use, a tool to help decide which one to use, and several features including plotting the adjusted significance thresholds against a Bonferroni correction as well as the compare tool to compare 2 algorithms against each other. Users are also able to download the results. The [Explore](https://mrc-bsu.shinyapps.io/onlineFDRShiny/) version of the app is meant for post-hoc use. For continuous usage, please see the [Stream](https://mrc-bsu.shinyapps.io/onlineFDRStream/) version.
